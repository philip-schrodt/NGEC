Halterman, Andrew, Philip A. Schrodt, Andreas Beger, Benjamin E. Bagozzi and Grace I.
Scarborough. 2023. “Creating Custom Event Data Without Dictionaries: A Bag-of-Tricks.”
Working Paper presented at the International Studies Association, Montreal, March-2023.

At present, and likely well into the future, this site will mostly contain some utility file useful in for reducing typing and typos, and a few code fragments, largely from the Huggingface and sklearn documentation with slight modifications, which clarify exactly what we mean by ``default'' paramters and technique. The complete data-generation pipeline is actually at Leidos and probably the U.S. government---which in the past has been disinclined to share[^1]  holds the intellectual property rights to this, that issue yet to be decided by hundreds of lawyers, so it isn't here.

Which is say, there's not a turn-key system here. But the absent code is routine, if you know enough to be creating an event data pipeline, you know enough to write this sort of code, and will almost certainly be better off writing using whatever idiomatic style you are comfortable with rather than adapting to ours. Or rather, mine [^2]

[^1]: Why utterly mundane code funded entirely by U.S. taxpayers remains propreiary while billions of dollars of pathbreaking and exceedingly high quality software generated by private corporations such as Alphabet/Google, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft has been made open source is, well, a great mystery.

[^2]: Which includes—I'm not making this up—occasional integer loop indices labelled `ka`, `kb`... because variables beginning with "k" were integers in FORTRAN IV and using the suffrixes 'a', 'b'... rather than '1', '2' saved hitting the numerical shift key on a card punch, said shift requiring moving approximately as much finely machined, but not necessarily balanced, brass and steel as a Honda Civic. But nowadays my code mostly just uses iterators. Honest.
