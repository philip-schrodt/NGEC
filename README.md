New Generation Event Coder 


Which is to say, if you know enough to be creating an event data pipeline, you know enough to write this sort of code, and will almost certainly be better off writing using whatever idiomatic style you are comfortable with rather than adapting to ours. Or rather, mine [^1]


## CAMEO_codefile.txt, CAMEO2PLOVER-2021-09-17.txt
CAMEO to PLOVER conversion files

## PLOVER_lists.txt
Assorted Python-formated lists including PLOVER categories, 4-character category abbreviations, modes, contexts, and intensity scores.




[^1]: Which includes—I'm not making this up—occasional integer loop indices labelled `ka`, `kb`... because variables beginning with "k" were integers in FORTRAN IV and using the suffrixes 'a', 'b'... rather than '1', '2' saved hitting the numerical shift key on a card punch, said shift requiring the mechanical movement of approximately as much finely machined, but not necessarily balanced, brass and steel as a Honda Civic. But nowadays my code mostly just uses iterators. Honest.
